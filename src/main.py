Explanation of Each Component
1. Simulated Hardware Classes:
    BatterySensor: Decreases battery level each loop to simulate power usage.
    Motor: Contains movement methods.
    VacuumMotor and WaterPump: Simulate starting the vacuum and water spray.
2. Obstacle Detection:
    Sensor: Uses random selection to simulate obstacle detection.
3.WiFi Connection:
    WiFiModule: Simulates connecting to a WiFi network.

Running the Code
1. Install Python: Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Create a Python File: Save the code in a file with a .py extension.
3. Run in Visual Studio Code: Open the file in Visual Studio Code, and press F5 or run it in the terminal with python filename.py.

Next Steps

For an actual hardware implementation, each class (like Motor, Sensor, etc.) would need to be replaced
by code interfacing with the real device's hardware via libraries or APIs, 
such as gpiozero for Raspberry Pi GPIO control, or pySerial for communication with motor drivers and sensors.
